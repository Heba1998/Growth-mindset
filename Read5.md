* ### Comparision operator

   * **=** *equal to*
      * *is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable*

   * **===**	*equal value and equal type *    
      * *is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.*

   * **!=**	*not equal*
      * *The inequality operator (!=) checks whether its two operands are not equal, returning a Boolean result.*
   *   **!==**	*not equal value or not equal type *
      * *Not equal is an comparison operator which is used to check the value of two operands are equal or not.*
     *If the value of two operands are not equal it returns true.*

   *  **<** *	less than*
      * *Checks whether left operand is less than right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.*

   * **>**	*greater than *    
      * *Checks whether left side value is greater than right side value. If yes then returns true otherwise false.*

   * **<=**	*less than or equal to*
      * *Checks whether left operand is less than or equal to right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.*

   *   **>==**	*greater than or equal to *
      * *Checks whether left operand is greater than or equal to right operand. If yes then returns true otherwise false.* 



 * ### Logical operation

   * **&&** *And*
      * *&& is known as AND operator. It checks whether two operands are non-zero (0, false, undefined, null or "" are considered as zero), if yes then returns 1 otherwise 0.*

   * **OR**    
      * *is known as OR operator. It checks whether any one of the two operands is non-zero (0, false, undefined, null or "" is considered as zero)..*

   * **!**	*Not*
      * *The inequality operator (!=) checks whether its two operands are not equal, returning a Boolean result.*
  


 * ### Loops

 *Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.*

   * **Kinds of Loops:**
     * **For**
     *loops through a block of code a number of times*
     > **for (statement 1** (*is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.*); **statement 2** (*defines the condition for executing the code block.*); **statement 3** (*is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed)* **) {
     // code block to be executed
     }**

        
     * **While**
     *loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true*
     >**while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed}**
