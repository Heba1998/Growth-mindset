* Local Repository Structure:
*The local Git repository has three components:*
 1.Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
 2.Index: The area used for staging.
 3.Head: Points to the most recent commit

 * Saving Changes
All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.

**Tracked**

Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.

**Untracked**

Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

*After cloning a repository, files have tracked status and are unmodified because they have been checked out but not edited.*
