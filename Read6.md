## How js makes web pages more interactive
1. Access contact
  * You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page

2. Modify content
  * You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.  

3. Program rules 
  * You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. 

4. React to event
  * You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.   

####  Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:
**Access** *the content of the page*
**Modify** *the content of the page*
**Program** *rules or instructions the browser can follow*
**React** *to events triggered by the user or browser*


* ### Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming.

1. What is a script and how do I creat one? 
  * A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
  * Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
  * Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
  * To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

1. EXPRESSIONS
*An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.*
   1. *EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE*
   2. *EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE*

2. OPERATORS
*Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.*



**WHAT IS A FUNCTION IN JAVASCRIPT?**

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
